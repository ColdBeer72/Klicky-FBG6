# Klicky-FBG6
Klicky endstop for Flying Bear Ghost 6

Based on the [Condor Head for FBG6](https://github.com/Chiffa-C3) by [Chiffa](https://github.com/Chiffa-C3) which is based on the well-knopwn [Klicky-Probe by Jlas1](https://github.com/jlas1/Klicky-Probe). It gives Flying Bear Ghost 6 standard (stock) printer head klicky-probe support.

This design includes four parts:
- Klicky-Probe (which jumps from the printer head to the dock and viceversa)
- Klicky-Dock (the part where the probe usually remains. The Dock is attached to the dock-support)
- Klicky-Dock-Support (attached to the chamber fan)
- A new back-side of the printer head box to replace the stock one, and where Probe is attached when needed.
